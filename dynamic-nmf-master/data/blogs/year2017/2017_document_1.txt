I’m delighted to be compering the DatSci Awards for the second year in a row. Data Science is one of the fastest growing sectors at the moment with excellent job opportunities and some stellar homegrown talent. The ultimate goal of data science is improving decision making, as this generally is of paramount interest to business. This years awards recognise the diversity of data scientists contributing to many different fields within the private and public sector.  A recent article outlined that our most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data. This was an inevitable outcome as we progress deeper into the information age. The proliferation of smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Data Scientists are analyzing swathes of data every day and using this information to make better decisions which in turn make our lives easier. The possibilities are extremely exciting as we look even 5 years ahead into the future. Just last week a troop of autonomous trucks took to the motorways in the UK and Tesla’s ludicrous growth is brilliant to see. Ireland has become a European hub for data science with many of the biggest companies in the world locating their data science centres on these shores, our data science talent is also an attraction and we need to do more to recognise them. It’s important to mark the significance of Ireland’s contribution to data science and these awards are a welcome addition to the Irish events calendar. After it’s tremendous success last year it’s fantastic to see the growth of the event just one year after it’s inception. The change of location from the Aviva to Croke Park was a natural progression as the awards have doubled in size – a very fitting location to celebrate Ireland’s best and brightest talent. And we want you to be there too to celebrate Data Science with us. Tickets for this unforgettable Data Science event are selling fast so get  your ticket  for the DatSci Awards today!

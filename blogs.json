This also translates to the fact that instead of a small fraction asking for high levels of critical care, society is moving to a state where wellness care should be provided to all to achieve healthier lives.", "This blog talks about how data science can help the sports coaches and doctors of the future to achieve this goal.

This in turn can be enormously insightful in gauging how well an athlete or the patient performing and therefore fine-tune their training or medication.", "\u00a0", "How have doctors and coaches dealt with data?", "Coaches and doctors tackle two subsequent sets of tasks (from a data science point of view). First, they collate the available historical data of the athlete or the patient to determine their present fitness or health condition. Subsequently, they prescribe a routine or medication based on how a typical patient in that condition has historically been handled.", "Historically, the first task involved maintaining paper based fitness charts and histories or doctors\u2019 prescriptions. Nowadays, technical gyms allow their subscribers to record workout durations and map how the same affects the user\u2019s vitals like heart rate, etc. With the advent of electronic health record, where patient data is stored in a secure remote server (colloquially, the cloud), doctors can update and view patient data across clinics. However most electronic health records are accessible to certified physicians only at a relatively local scale ", "i.e.", " either a state or a country.", "The second part involves making judgements based on experience or relevant sports or clinical investigations. The coach can look into the athlete\u2019s workout data every few days or weeks, and tweak the routine appropriately based on his prior experience. The doctors often refer to a medical journal or refer to case studies to determine the appropriate course of action. Of course, this is built upon the top of years of experience gathered both during training at medical school and while actually practicing medicine.", "\u00a0", "What are some of the cutting edge solutions available now?", "The first step of the challenge ", "i.e.", " storing medical or health data online, is widely available in EU and USA, and several developing countries are quickly catching up.", "The second step, automation, where the devices are themselves smart enough to give personalised feedback in real time to achieve the desired outcome (for both fitness and medical goals) is the current challenge. To achieve this the device needs to be wearable ", "i.e", ". the person should have the both the sensor and the computational module on his body. The device should also come up with a haptic ", "i.e.", " vibration, voice or a visual method of communicating the instructions to the athlete or the patient in a reasonably intuitive manner.

Companies like Athos, Myontec, Hexoskin and Clothing+ are leading the trend by selling smart apparel that have built in ECG sensors and well as motion trackers. These could eventually be used as a platform for building a personalised feedback mechanism. Even activity trackers like Fitbit and Jawbone are focussing beyond building just step counters to more holistic solutions for health and wellness. They are among the first companies to build a Device + App paradigm that will help people to lead a healthier lifestyle based on real time tracking of health data.", "How we hope QuasaR\u2122 will lead this revolution?", "Our product QuasaR\u2122 is a wearable personal fitness trainer that fits inside sports apparel. QuasaR\u2122 helps users build cardiac and respiratory endurance and reduce obesity and stress by suggesting the optimal running intensity and duration, based on the user\u2019s personal fitness goals. QuasaR\u2122 measures the user\u2019s heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and heart rate variability with medical grade accuracy and combines this data with information about the user\u2019s speed to report fitness predictors such as vVO2max, heart rate-running speed index, etc. These predictors are then used to recommend personalised coaching routines designed by fitness coaches towards achieving endurance goals.", "For example, QuasaR\u2122 can help athletes build cardiac endurance by first tracking how their heart rate increases with the running speed during warm-up sessions. Then during the actual training QuasaR\u2122 uses haptic feedback to keep the user running at the lowest speed where they achieve their highest heart rate. Therefore the athlete can build their cardiac endurance without risking the chance of over exhaustion.", "For the next few years, we will focus on building a large set of running and cycling regimens with QuasaR\u2122, beyond just endurance building exercise. This includes programmes to take the athlete from couch to 5K in a month, or even an optimal way to run the Dublin Marathon.", "However, we hope that some day this will be the stepping-stone for building a medical grade version of QuasaR\u2122, which will perform similar recovery routines for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illnesses.", "\u00a0", "Is Data Science Going to Replace Sports Coaches and Doctors?", "Well, we believe that the answer is no. Activity trackers like Fitbit or Jawbone or fitness trackers like QuasaR\u2122, Hexoskin and Athos will come up with diverse routines for giving real time feedback. However these devices will rely on the experience of professional coaches and doctors to build the new training regimens.

To be clear, we were not talking about predicting any old marathon finish-time, based on a recent half-marathon or 10k race time; there are plenty of race calculators available to do this. Rather, we were interested in predicting a\u00a0", "challenging but achievable", "\u00a0PB time, which a runner might be capable of pushing themself to achieve.

These results are for the London Marathon, but analogous results have been obtained for Chicago, Berlin, Boston, and other cities. For example, it predicts that marathoners who are currently running London in 150-minutes should be capable of improving their times by about 5 minutes in the future, to achieve a PB of 145 minutes. As current finish-times increase, so too does the potential for improvement and, in general, men enjoy greater potential for improvement than women for a given finish-time. For example, 240-minute male finishers can expect to improve by up to 22 minutes in the future, while 240-minute women can expect improvements of about 17 minutes.", "How did we generate these predictions? Let\u2019s get back to the task at hand and describe exactly how we used case-based reasoning as the basis for this.", "Let\u2019s begin by carefully defining the problem we wish to solve and by making some simplifying assumptions about how we might approach it. For a given runner we wish to predict a challenging but achievable finish-time, for a given marathon course, and we also want to recommend a pacing plan to help them achieve this time. For simplicity we will assume this plan will take the form of a sequence of paces (mins/km) for each of the 5km segments/splits of the marathon (5k, 10k, 15k,\u00a0\u2026, 35k, 40k) plus the final 2.2km segment (from 40k to the finish). Moreover, we will assume that all we have to go on, when it comes to generating this prediction and plan, is a\u00a0", "single marathon", "\u00a0that our runner has previously run.

So, a pacing plan is what a runner\u00a0", "should", "\u00a0run. A pacing profile is what a runner\u00a0", "did", "\u00a0run.", "How might we begin to solve this problem? What information have we that might help, in addition to Ann\u2019s previous marathon record? Well, we have plenty of race records for past runners of London, and some of these are repeat runners, with multiple London marathons under their belts.", "Imagine a runner, Sarah, who has completed three London marathons, one in 252 minutes, one in 244 minutes, and one in 236 minutes. Sarah\u2019s 253-minute finish-time is close to Ann\u2019s, and Sarah went on to achieve a faster time (236 minutes) some time later. Does this suggest that Ann might also be capable of achieving a similar speed-up? It\u2019s a reasonable start.", "We might find additional support among other repeat runners with similar non-PB times to Ann, and who subsequently went on to achieve faster times. For example, we might consider the 10 or 20 runners with the most similar non-PB finish-times to Ann, who all went on to run even faster finish-times. Then we have a set of 10 or 20 faster finish-times, all by people who were similar to Ann, and we could use the average of their faster finish-times as a predicted PB for Ann, arguing that these runners were once like Ann and so, all other things being equal, it is reasonable to predict that Ann might improve in a manner similar to these runners in the future.", "The basic idea, as outlined, is an example of case-based reasoning. This is a common machine learning technique, based on the intuition that, to solve some new problem (predicting a PB time for Ann) we should look to similar\u00a0", "problems", "\u00a0in the past (those runners who ran similar non-PB times to Ann) and use their\u00a0", "solutions", "\u00a0(subsequent PB times) as the basis of a prediction for Ann. That is CBR in a nutshell.", "Every CBR system is based on a collection of past problems (the\u00a0", "cases\u00a0", "in a\u00a0", "case base", "), each with its own\u00a0", "problem description", "\u00a0and\u00a0", "solution component", ", and to solve a new problem we identify the the most similar cases, based on their problem descriptions, and adapt their solutions to fit the new problem situation.", "Case-based reasoning has some nice properties. It is intuitive and its solutions are straightforward to explain to end-users, with reference to the similar cases that have been adapted. It is computationally straightforward and relatively easy to implement in code. One of the most important advantages of CBR is that its decision-making relies on\u00a0", "examples", ", in the form of cases, rather than the carefully-crafted, hand-coded rules, which have been commonplace in more traditional forms of knowledge-based AI systems. This also means that it is easy for a CBR system to learn to solve new problems, by simply adding more cases to the case base. In the case of our marathon PB prediction task, if we have lots and lots of cases, covering male and female runners, of all ages and experience levels, and representing a wide range of finish-times, then we have a good chance of being able to find similar runners to act as a basis of a prediction for any given runner whose PB we wish to predict.", "A key idea in case-based reasoning concerns how we determine the similarity between a new situation (Ann\u2019s recent marathon race) and a past problem in some case (Sarah\u2019s non-PB race). We have suggested that this might simply be calculated on the basis of just their finish-times\u200a\u2014\u200aSarah\u2019s 252-minute finish is very similar to Ann\u2019s 253-minute finish, plus they are both female\u200a\u2014\u200abut we can do better than that. For example, we can look at the pacing profile of Ann and Sarah during their non-PB races. Suppose for the sake of argument that, although Ann and Sarah have very similar finish-times, their pacing profiles are quite different. For example, suppose Ann started fast and produced a positive-split, with the first half of her race faster than the second, where as Sarah started more cautiously, and went on to finish with a negative-split, with the second half of the race faster than the first. In contrast, Paula, another 252-minute finisher, like Sarah, has a positive-split pacing profile that is more similar to Ann\u2019s. Accordingly, despite their identical finish-times Paula is considered to be more sinilar to Ann than Sarah, because Paula paced her race more similarly to Ann than Sarah.", "In other words, when we measure similarity we use pacing information as well as finish-times and gender. The more similar another runner is to Ann, the greater the influence of their PB time on Ann\u2019s prediction. In fact, we consider 3 ways to product a predicted PB time for a runner like Ann, from a set of similar cases:", "Best", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe take the fastest PB time from the most similar runners.", "Mean", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe take the average PB time from the most similar runners.", "Even", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe take the PB time of the similar runner with the most even pacing profile, on the basis that more even pacing is usually considered to be more optimal for the marathon distance.", "In addition to predicting a PB time we also need to suggest a pacing plan to help runners achieve it, which depends greatly on the conditions of a given race course. Once again this is based on the pacing profiles of the PB races from the most similar runners to Ann, but adjusted to fit Ann\u2019s predicted PB time. And once again, we consider 3 basic approaches:", "Best", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe use the pacing profile of the most similar runner.", "Mean", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe use the average pacing profile, using the profiles of all of the similar runners.", "Even", "\u200a\u2014\u200awe use the pacing profile of the similar runner with the most evenly paced PB.", "All of this is illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 2(a) we see Ann\u2019s 253-minute race with a strong positive split\u200a\u2014\u200ashe started out 10% faster than her mean race-pace and finished about 7% slower\u200a\u2014\u200aas our new input. In Figure 2(b) represent how we generate a collection of cases from the race records of people who have run at least 2 races. In this case we show Sarah\u2019s 3 races with finish-times, 252, 244, and 236 minutes. The fastest (236 mins) is taken to be Sarah\u2019s PB time (for the purpose of this work) and used to produce two cases for our case base: one case combines Sarah\u2019s 252-minute non-PB time with her 236-minute PB, and the other combines her 244-minute finish with her 236-minute PB. Finally, in Figure 2(c) we see how Ann\u2019s 253-minute race is used to retrieve a set of similar cases (Sarah\u2019s included) to produce a predicted PB for Ann of 237 minutes, along with a new pacing plan for her. In this example, the new pacing plan is more even than Ann\u2019s non-PB plan. It starts out a little faster than her mean race pace, but not too fast, and finishes a little slower than her mean race pace, but not too slow, and in fact the final short segment of teh race calls for Ann to push for a faster finish.", "This summarises how we make our PB predictions, by adapting the PB times and pacing profiles of similar runners for our target runner. These similar runners all have past races that are similar to our target runner\u2019s performance, but they all went on to achieve faster times in the future, and these faster times, and their corresponding pacing profiles, are the basis of the prediction for the target runner.", "The more cases we have, the better the predictions are likely to be, and if we want to make predictions for a different marathon, let\u2019s say Chicago, then we can generate our cases from the race records of Chicago marathoners.

Once finished and debugged it was time to test our system.", "There are two ways to test such a system. The obvious approach (one we call an\u00a0", "online", "\u00a0experiment) is to deploy it and encourage runners to use it, and to report back on whether their predicted PB turned out to be accurate. The problem with this is that it can be expensive and slow: it needs to be promoted and advertised and it can take a long-time to obtain feedback from users.", "The alternative is an\u00a0", "offline", "\u00a0experiment where we use the data we already have to test the system.

Figure 3 shows the (a) prediction accuracy and (b) pacing profile similarity for each of the three strategies (", "Best", ",\u00a0", "Mean", ", and\u00a0", "Even", "), and for different numbers of retrieved cases; for each strategy we separate the results for male and female runners (the dotted/dashed boundaries of each \u2018", "ribbon plot\u2019", ") and also show the average over all runners (the marked central lines).", "These results indicate that the\u00a0", "Mean", "\u00a0strategy performs best overall, across all values of k>1.

The prediction error for females is consistently lower than for males, and the pacing profile similarity is higher for female runners than for male runners, regardless of strategy. The literature suggests that women are more consistent pacers than men and, as such, tend to run more disciplined races, which may make them inherently more predictable, compared with men.", "Building on this idea we might also wonder whether prediction accuracy depends on the runner\u2019s ability level. If faster runners are likely to be more disciplined, does this also make them more predictable? Evidently it does, as the results in Figure 4 testify; incidentally, we average the results for all values of\u00a0", "k", "\u00a0here for simplicity.", "Faster runners enjoy PB predictions with lower error rates, and pacing profiles/plans with higher similarities, compared with slower runners; once again we can see the\u00a0", "Mean", "\u00a0strategy tends to work best for all finish-times, and how women continue to enjoy better predictions and pacing plans than men. For example, the\u00a0", "Mean\u00a0", "strategy can predict a PB time with an error rate of only about 2%, for runners who are currently capable of a 150-minute London finish, and the pacing plan similarity is about 0.92. By comparison, for 240-minute finishers, the PB prediction error is considerably higher, at 6%, and pacing plan similarity falls to about 0.85.", "So far so good, especially for faster runners. One final matter to consider concerns the nature of the PBs encoded by cases. In this work, we pair non-PB times with PB times for London marathoners to produce our cases. Sometimes, the difference between a non-PB and a PB time is small, as runners gradually improve over time. Sometimes it is much larger; perhaps the runner in question has returned to London after a few years of steady progress, to register a big improvement on their previous time. Do small or large PB improvements matter with respect to prediction performance? Is it easier to make predictions for runners with more modest PB improvements than for runners who register much greater PBs?", "To test this, in Figure 5, we look at the average prediction error and pacing profile similarity, based on the percentage difference between the non-PB and PB time of cases. It turns out that it\u00a0", "is", "\u00a0", "easier", "\u00a0to make predictions for runners with more modest PB improvements, after all larger PB improvements are relatively rare in our data. For example, focusing on the\u00a0", "Mean\u00a0", "strategy, when the difference between a runner\u2019s non-PB time and their PB time is 5% (regardless of ability) then our predictions are accurate to within 3% and the pacing plans tend to have similarities of 88. But for runners with larger PB improvements, say 15%, then the prediction error grows to 10% and profile similarity falls to about 0.83.", "Interestingly, there comes a point when the\u00a0", "Best", "\u00a0strategy starts to win out, at least in terms of its prediction error. When the PB difference is greater than about 12%, then the\u00a0", "Best", "\u00a0strategy tends to produce PB predictions with the lowest error. But these are few and far between in practice.", "There is a lot more to say on all of this but that\u2019s probably enough for now. We have described an approach to helping runners to achieve a new marathon PB by suggesting challenging but achievable PB times and by recommending pacing plans to help a runner achieve such a time. We have also described an offline evaluation of this approach, which suggests it is capable of making predictions that are sufficiently accurate to be useful in practice.", "Research like this is fundamentally incremental in nature. Now that we have proven the basic concept it is time to refine and iterate, and there are lots of ways to do this. At the very least we need to enrich our cases. Why rely on a single non-PB race, for example? Surely it would be better to take a runner\u2019s race history? Yes it would. Would it also make sense to look at different machine learning techniques, other than case-based reasoning? Probably. Should we deploy it as a live system for runners to use ahead of their next marathon, and use their feedback to evaluate the approach? Certainly.", "In the coming months we will continue work on this and see where it takes us. At the very least, it should be possible to improve prediction accuracy to make the system more reliable for runners of all levels of ability. But our ambitions go beyond this and, in fact, we are looking at many different ways in which machine learning can be used to help marathon runners and other athletes, not just for PB prediction, but also for injury prevention, for recovery advice, to personalise training plans, etc.", " ", "\n", "\n"], "date": "June 30th, 2017"},

And business analytics is fundamentally about translation \u2013 translating a business problem into the language of algorithms and analysis, and translating a solution back into the language of clients and management.", "In this short article I will expand on this description of analytics, and then approach it from another angle by analysing the types of projects undertaken by the students of the UCD Smurfit MSc in Business Analytics.", "It\u2019s common to describe a kind of \u201cladder\u201d of analytics, progressing from descriptive through predictive to prescriptive analytics.", "A well-known example of the ladder model is Gartner\u2019s \u201cAnalytic Value Escalator\u201d which is reproduced below. It adds a category, diagnostic analytics, which in other models is merged with descriptive analytics. It suggests a progression up the ladder in terms both of sophistication and of potential value to the business.", "(Image source: ", "flickr", ")", "\u00a0", "To a first approximation, descriptive analytics means statistics, visualisation, and unsupervised learning; predictive means supervised learning including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees and forests; and prescriptive analytics means optimisation and decision analytics.", "Where do the current buzzwords of big data and deep learning fit into this? Both are at a perhaps surprisingly \u201clow\u201d rung of the ladder. Very few businesses actually deal with big data, and of those that do, the majority only need descriptive analytics on it. Deep learning is a class of methods that usually sit on the predictive rung of the ladder, along with plain old linear regression \u2013 a bit more sophisticated, and more powerful, but essentially answering the same types of questions.", "For most of these methods, some mathematical understanding is required to avoid making dangerous mistakes, though visualisation and machine learning methods are becoming increasingly commoditized. But for all types of analytics, a much broader array of skills are really needed:", "business insight and domain knowledge;", "communication with clients, management, and domain specialists;", "presentation, visualisation, and written reports;", "understanding of real-world decision-making processes;", "computing chops to munge data and glue algorithms together \u2013 even if you never write a line of optimisation or statistical code.", "This spectrum from basic to advanced analytics has been proposed to explain the analytics journey that organisations go through, and sometimes that is what happens in practice. However I think a more typical journey, for many organisation and individuals, may start with simple methods being applied at any rung of the ladder, followed by increased sophistication. For example, it is often possible to establish a simple automated classification system based only on domain knowledge and good data quality \u2013 no learning models required. This can be used as a baseline and a sanity check against which to measure more sophisticated machine learning methods as the organisation gains the required expertise.", "The above could be called an intensional definition of business analytics. But an extensional definition might be useful too: what do we talk about, when we talk about business analytics? In particular, what do analytics organisations talk about, when they come into our classrooms in UCD Smurfit?", "\nTo address this question, I have taken a data set consisting of the projects proposed by analytics organisations for collaboration with the students of the ", "UCD MSc in Business Analytics", " over the past 6 years.

Unsupervised learning is popular too. Natural language processing (NLP) and time-series methods are often required either as stand-alone methods or as inputs to other algorithms. Optimisation, including both \u201cclassical\u201d and metaheuristic optimisation remain popular, reflecting a broad interpretation of analytics and also reflecting its roots in the field of operations research.", "Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is the term I\u2019m using for the field of decision analytics which is not primarily about data and computation, but rather about understanding and improving the decision-making process \u2013 based on evidence. Again, this reflects a broader set of concerns than just \u201cdata for its own sake\u201d.", "Our partners also often suggest more niche methods including spatial analytics, recommender systems, network models, and simulation methods.", "We can draw a few conclusions and speculate about the future. Over time, we have noticed an increased interest in extracting value from text, spatial, network and other forms of non-tabular data. This reflects business intuition that value can be extracted from such data, and a recognition that basic tools and approaches \u2013 say, linear regression in Excel \u2013 are a bad fit.", "\nThe dominance of supervised learning suggests that there are opportunities for deep learning and other advanced algorithms which can go beyond the performance of standard regression and classification techniques.", "However, \u201cunsupervised learning is believed to be a key for future progress on deep learning towards AI\u201d (", "Bengio", "). We believe that unsupervised learning will tend to grow in importance, in comparison with supervised learning. This reflects the increased power of algorithms for unsupervised learning \u2013 probably the biggest achievement of deep learning so far \u2013 but in particular it reflects the wide availability of large datasets which are suitable for unsupervised learning but not for supervised.

they actually had to open up the page to make a decision.", "We created a very simple job that contained 10 panels with a link and a dropdown, as shown below.", "We had a data set of hand-picked links to use as our ground-truth test questions, approximately 90 fashion links, and 45 non-fashion links. \u00a0We then also picked some of the links we had from our DMOZ data set, and used those to run some experiments on. \u00a0Since this was solely about learning how to use the platform, we didn\u2019t agonize over this data set, we just picked 100 nominally fashion links, and 100 nominally non-fashion links, and uploaded those as the data to use for the questions.", "We ran two initial experiments: the first one we had tried to use some of the more exotic, interesting \u201cQuality Control\u201d settings that CrowdFlower makes available, but we found that the number of \u201cUntrusted Judgements\u201d was far too high compared to \u201cTrusted Judgements\u201d. \u00a0We simply stopped the job, copied it and launched another.", "The second of the initial experiments proved quite promising: we got 200 links classified, with 3 judgements per link (so 600 trusted judgements in total). \u00a0The classifications from the reviewers matched the DMOZ labels pretty closely. \u00a0All the links where the DMOZ label and the CrowdFlower reviewers disagreed were examined; there was one borderline case that was understandable, and the rest were actually indicative of the noise we expected to see in the DMOZ labels.", "Interestingly, we really overpaid on the first job. \u00a0Dial down the costs until after you\u2019ve run a few experiments. \u00a0If the \u201cContributor Satisfaction\u201d panel on the main monitoring page has a \u201cgood\u201d (green) rating, you\u2019re probably paying too much.", "Start simple. \u00a0While it is tempting to play with the advanced features right from the get-go, don\u2019t. \u00a0They can cause problems with your job running smoothly;

we were estimating about 20% noise on the DMOZ labels. \u00a0We also wanted a high level of agreement, so links that had 3/3 reviewers agreeing. \u00a0From the previous experiments, we were getting unanimous agreement on about 80% of the links seen. \u00a0So 10k + noise + agreement + fudge factor + human predilection for nice round numbers = 15k.", "We launched the job in the afternoon;
